"""Specialized autonomous delivery drone with intelligent routing and package management.

This module implements the DeliveryDrone class, a specialized concrete implementation of
Drone[DeliveryTask] that provides sophisticated delivery operations including optimal route
planning, package lifecycle management, and state-aware task execution. The class demonstrates
advanced drone framework extensibility through strategic method overriding and delivery-specific
behavioral patterns.

Core Delivery Features:
    Intelligent Route Optimization:
        • Multi-task distance-based routing for efficiency maximization
        • State-aware destination selection (pickup vs dropoff priorities)
        • Dynamic task prioritization based on DeliveryState progression
        • Automatic mission sequencing for multi-package operations

    Package Lifecycle Management:
        • Comprehensive tracking from assignment through completion
        • Timing-based pickup and dropoff coordination
        • Automatic state progression through delivery workflow
        • Ground service operations with configurable wait times

    Type-Safe Task Specialization:
        • Concrete implementation of Drone[DeliveryTask] with full type safety
        • Compile-time validation preventing incompatible task assignments
        • DeliveryTask-specific method signatures and behavior patterns
        • Integration with DeliveryState enumeration for workflow control

Advanced Architecture:
    State Machine Integration:
        The DeliveryDrone seamlessly integrates with both the base Drone state machine
        (GROUNDED, TAKING_OFF, NAVIGATING, LANDING, EMERGENCY) and the DeliveryTask
        state machine (ASSIGNED, SERVICE_PICKUP, SERVICE_DROPOFF, DONE) to provide
        coordinated multi-level state management.

    Method Override Strategy:
        • _try_assign_new_destination(now): Smart routing with distance optimization
        • on_grounded(dt, now): Ground operations with delivery-specific logic
        • enter_grounded(now): State entry with mission progression and cleanup
        • Internal timing functions for pickup/dropoff coordination

    Operational Workflow:
        1. Task Queue Management: Receive and prioritize DeliveryTask assignments
        2. Intelligent Routing: Select optimal destinations based on task states
        3. Flight Operations: Navigate using inherited drone flight capabilities
        4. Ground Services: Execute pickup/dropoff with timing coordination
        5. Mission Completion: Automatic cleanup and preparation for next delivery

Performance & Efficiency:
    Route Optimization Algorithms:
        • Nearest-neighbor selection for multiple pending deliveries
        • State-based task filtering to prioritize workflow progression
        • Distance calculations using geodetic positioning for accuracy
        • Dynamic re-routing when new high-priority tasks are assigned

    Resource Management:
        • Efficient task queue processing with automatic cleanup
        • Memory-optimized mission tracking with single active mission
        • Battery-aware operations inherited from base Drone class
        • Scalable architecture supporting high-volume delivery operations

    Core Dependencies:
        • dronesim.mission: DeliveryTask and DeliveryState for task management
        • dronesim.unit: Time measurements for temporal coordination
        • .drone: Base Drone class providing flight and state capabilities

    Optional Extensions:
        • Custom payload management systems
        • Advanced routing algorithms (TSP, genetic algorithms)
        • Real-time traffic and weather integration
        • Multi-drone coordination and fleet optimization

Usage Examples:
    Basic Delivery Operations:
        >>> from dronesim.geo import GeoPoint
        >>> from dronesim.energy import BatteryStatus
        >>> from dronesim.mission import DeliveryTask
        >>> from dronesim.unit import WattHour, Time
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize delivery drone with starting configuration
        >>> battery = BatteryStatus(capacity=WattHour(100), current=WattHour(95))
        >>> home_base = GeoPoint.from_deg(latitude=37.5665, longitude=126.9780)
        >>> delivery_drone = DeliveryDrone(pos=home_base, battery=battery)
        >>>
        >>> # Create delivery mission with pickup and dropoff locations
        >>> pickup_location = GeoPoint.from_deg(37.5700, 126.9800)
        >>> delivery_destination = GeoPoint.from_deg(37.5750, 126.9850)
        >>> delivery_task = DeliveryTask(origin=pickup_location, destination=delivery_destination)
        >>>
        >>> # Assign mission (type-safe, only accepts DeliveryTask)
        >>> success = delivery_drone.assign(delivery_task)
        >>> assert success == True  # Drone accepts compatible task types only

    Multi-Task Scenario:
        >>> # Queue multiple deliveries for optimized routing
        >>> task1 = DeliveryTask(pickup1, dropoff1)
        >>> task2 = DeliveryTask(pickup2, dropoff2)
        >>> task3 = DeliveryTask(pickup3, dropoff3)
        >>>
        >>> delivery_drone.assign(task1)
        >>> delivery_drone.assign(task2)
        >>> delivery_drone.assign(task3)
        >>>
        >>> # Drone automatically optimizes routing based on current position
        >>> # and task states, selecting nearest pickup/dropoff locations first

    """Autonomous delivery drone with intelligent routing and multi-state task coordination.

    DeliveryDrone is a concrete specialization of Drone[DeliveryTask] that implements
    sophisticated delivery operations through multi-layered state management, intelligent
    route optimization, and comprehensive package lifecycle tracking. This class demonstrates
    advanced drone framework extensibility while maintaining full compatibility with the
    base drone architecture and state machine framework.

    Architectural Design:
        Multi-Level State Coordination:
            • Base Drone States: GROUNDED, TAKING_OFF, NAVIGATING, LANDING, EMERGENCY
            • Delivery States: ASSIGNED, SERVICE_PICKUP, SERVICE_DROPOFF, DONE
            • Coordinated transitions between flight and delivery state machines
            • Automatic state progression with timing-based service operations

        Intelligent Task Management:
            • Priority-based task selection using DeliveryState ordering
            • Distance-optimized routing for multi-delivery efficiency
            • Dynamic destination assignment based on current task states
            • Automatic mission cleanup and queue management

        Type Safety & Extensibility:
            • Generic type specialization: Drone[DeliveryTask] for compile-time safety
            • Method override pattern for delivery-specific behaviors
            • Integration hooks for custom delivery logic and extensions
            • Full inheritance of base drone capabilities and configurations

    Core Delivery Algorithms:
        Route Optimization Strategy:
            1. State-Based Prioritization: Tasks in earlier states (ASSIGNED) take precedence
               over tasks in later states (SERVICE_PICKUP) for optimal workflow progression
            2. Distance Minimization: Among tasks in the same state, select the closest
               destination to minimize flight time and energy consumption
            3. Dynamic Re-routing: Automatically recalculate routes when new tasks are assigned
               or when missions are completed and removed from the queue

        Mission Execution Flow:
            1. Task Assignment: Receive DeliveryTask through type-safe assign() method
            2. Queue Processing: Move queued tasks to active tasks when ready for execution
            3. Destination Selection: Use _try_assign_new_destination() for optimal routing
            4. Flight Execution: Leverage inherited drone flight capabilities for navigation
            5. Ground Operations: Execute pickup/dropoff with timing-based state progression
            6. Mission Completion: Automatic cleanup and preparation for next delivery cycle

    Specialized Attributes:
        _current_mission (DeliveryTask | None): Reference to the currently executing delivery
                                              task. Set when a destination is assigned and flight
                                              begins, cleared when mission reaches DONE state.
                                              Used for ground operation coordination and state
                                              progression during pickup/dropoff operations.

    Inherited Capabilities:
        From Drone[DeliveryTask]:
            • battery (BatteryStatus): Energy management and operational thresholds
            • position (GeoPoint): WGS84 geographic positioning with navigation methods
            • velocity (Velocity): Configurable cruising speed for flight operations
            • task_queue (deque[DeliveryTask]): Type-safe queue for pending deliveries
            • State machine framework with validated transitions and timing control
            • Power consumption modeling for different flight phases
            • Base station coordination and return-to-base capabilities

    Method Override Specializations:

            • Service operation timing for pickup and dropoff coordination
            • Mission state progression through delivery workflow
            • Automatic task cleanup when deliveries reach completion
            • Destination assignment logic for next mission execution

        Route Planning (_try_assign_new_destination):
            • Multi-criteria task selection using state and distance metrics
            • Dynamic destination assignment based on delivery progression
            • Flight initiation and mission reference management
            • Integration with drone state machine for seamless transitions

    Performance Characteristics:
        Optimization Features:

            • Efficient distance calculations using geodetic math
            • Memory-optimized single active mission tracking
            • Automatic queue management with minimal memory footprint

        Scalability Considerations:
            • Supports concurrent operation in multi-drone fleets
            • Compatible with real-time simulation frameworks
            • Extensible for advanced routing algorithms (TSP, genetic algorithms)

        coordinating pickup and dropoff operations within the broader delivery workflow.

        Operational Architecture:
            Ground Service Coordination:
                The method implements nested service functions that handle timing-based operations
                for pickup and dropoff states. These functions coordinate with the delivery task
